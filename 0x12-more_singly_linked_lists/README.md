# Single Linked Lists (Continued)
These functions handle more advanced operations such as popping, searching for a node at a given index, sum of all node data, inserting node at any index, deleting node at any index, reversing the linked list, safely printing all nodes, deleting nodes safely, finding loop in linkedlist
