# Single Linked List
The C files are basic single linked list programs. The Python files are most advanced topics such as:

* Check if a linked list is a palindrome

* Compute the average value of `ints` in the nodes of a single linked list

* Compute the sum of `ints` in the nodes of a single linked list
